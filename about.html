<h1>About Us</h1>
<h4>The Bigfoot Tracker came to fruition through a need of a centralized location for Bigfoot sightings. Other websites that set out with the same mission have fragmented information and is confusingly laid out. The Bigfoot Tracker aims to create a definitive place for enthusiasts to find and report sightings all with a visually appealing presentation.</h4>
