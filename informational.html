<h1>Information</h1>
<h4>Bigfoot and similar creatures are all inherently mysterious. Despite this, there are definitive rules in identifying which type of creature you have encountered. There are tell-tale signs of differentiation that a knowledgable individual will be able to identify almost immediately. The three creatures we will be differentiating between is Sasquatch, Bigfoot, and Yetis. 

  Sasquatches are the most human-like of the three. Typically shorter than their contemporaries, Sasquatches are the least dangerous to encounter in the wild. Very hairy in nature, Sasquatches will usually avoid human interaction and aren’t usually threatening. Bigfoots are much taller than Sasquatches. Their titular big feet are the easiest method of identification. They are most commonly seen in rigorous terrain, however, and are much more rare than Sasquatches. While both Sasquatches and Bigfoots resemble apes, the Yeti is more bear-like. The most aggressive of the three, Yeti’s almost exclusively dwell in Arctic regions.</h4>
