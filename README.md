This semester, you will be working in a group (i.e., two students per group) to design, implement, test, and revise any Web-based application, as approved by your instructor. Your project must be entirely designed, implemented, tested (with help from your family, friends, and classmates), and revised by your group. It must also incorporate these components:

Well-structured and valid HTML pages
Elements of good Web design embodied in a CSS stylesheet.
A minimum of 2 responsive pages in the primary user application.
A dashboard page for the administrative functions. 
A relational database with at minimum 2 related tables.
Interaction with a database -- using select, inserts, update, or delete queries.
Feel free to use any resources/technologies available. You are expected to build your project based on skills learned in class or outside of class, however, you should be comfortable explaining any technology you used in your project to students in case questions rises during the final project presentation.

An example of a good final project would be An online survey Web application.  Users provide responses to survey questions.  The application stores the responses in a database.  An administrator's page provides a dashboard where the administrator can view the number of respondents, delete a response, view other analytics such as frequency of responses per day or frequency of responses per question, etc. 

NOTES:

more examples are provided in the Previous Students Projects page
using graphs (e.g., Google Charts (Links to an external site.), AnyChart (Links to an external site.), etc..) in your admin page would definitely increase your project value.  These will be introduced in the class as time permits (and they are not required in the project but are very good to have).
 

Students are required to present their work during finals week. The project is due on the deadline date in fully working condition; submission requirements include:

1) a zipped (compressed) folder with all of your project files (e.g., .HTML, .CSS, .JS, and .PHP files)

2) a URL pointing to your fully working application.

3) Your group Powerpoint slides.

Milestone 1 comments: the project idea is really interesting, here are some notes to keep in mind... always think of the information that will be saved to the database, and the information will be retrieved from the database. just from the project description, I can feel that the website is going to be implemented mostly using javascript.. make sure you use PHP and SQL.. we will cover those after the fall break.. also you should think of a dashboard page where admins can login to see various info about the website and be able to modify some information or add some information.
